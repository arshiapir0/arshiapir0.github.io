	<h2>WHO ARE WE?</h2>
	</section>
	<p>The dictionary defines a video game as an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a two or three-dimensional video display device. But we didn't feel that truly encapsulated the art of gaming. We believed videogames always must provoke a deeper emotional response from the audience, to provide a sense of awe and pride. So a group of 4 friends got together and founded EpicGamer Games, or EGG. A new age of videogames which will bring something completely new to the industry. </p>
